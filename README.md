# CV in LaTeX

This is my Curriculum Vitae in LaTeX.
It uses the [moderncv](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv?lang=en) LaTeX class.

`Razvan_Deaconescu_CV.tex` is the CV in Romanian.
`Razvan_Deaconescu_CV_en.tex` is the CV in English.

Use `make` to build the PDF files (Romanian and English).

[Publications](https://github.com/razvand/my-bibtex-publications) can be included as part of the CV.
That part is currently commented out in the `.tex` files.
